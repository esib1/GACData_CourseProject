##Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

####Test/Train Intertial Data

'[test/train]/subject_[test/train].txt': One row per subject who performed activity for each window. Its range is from 1 to 30.

'[test/train]/Inertial Signals/total_acc_[x/y/z]_[test/train].txt': Acceleration signal from the smartphone's accelerometer z/y/z axis (standard gravity units 'g'). Every row is a vector of 128 elements.

'[test/train]/Inertial Signals/body_acc_[x/y/z]_[test/train].txt': Body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

'[test/train]/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_[x/y/z]_[test/train].txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample (in radians/second).
